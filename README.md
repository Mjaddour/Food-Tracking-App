# App Project
# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The Weight Tracking app is designed to monitor user weight by recording meals, quantity, and weight. The app assists in tracking your weight, enabling you to observe improvements resulting from your diet or indicating the need for a change in your dietary approach.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The success of the app relies on the necessity of the screen for uploading meals, quantity, and weight, as it constitutes the primary function and purpose of the application. Consistently maintaining the same theme across all app pages enhances user experience, while the feature to receive notifications serves as a valuable reminder for the user.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
In developing the Weight Tracking app, I began by meticulously defining clear requirements to ensure the app's functionality aligned seamlessly with user needs. Before diving into coding, I adopted a systematic approach that involved thorough planning of the architecture. This included ensuring that every page was thoroughly tested to meet all specified requirements and cater to user needs. By emphasizing this meticulous planning process, I aimed to establish a solid foundation for the app's development, enhancing its overall effectiveness and user satisfaction.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To ensure the functionality of the code in the Weight Tracking app, a comprehensive testing approach was implemented. This involved a combination of unit testing, integration testing, This testing process is crucial for several reasons. First and foremost, it helps identify and rectify bugs or errors in the code, ensuring the app functions as intended.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Implementing both features, deletion and updating of entries, posed a challenge that required a different approach. Opting for user convenience, I decided to allow users to press on the entry and then choose to either delete or update through a text-based option. This approach provided a more user-friendly experience, allowing users to easily modify or delete entries and ensuring a pleasant interaction with the app.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Saving user entries was a notably successful aspect of the app development. It served as a valuable learning experience, applying the knowledge gained from classes on data handling. Leveraging what I learned, I successfully implemented the requirement, enabling my app to effectively manage and handle user entries.
